Questions:
1. class in the package 'trees' and the connections between them:
    a. 'Flora' - as required at the instructions, this object contains a static
     method which creates all the flora's object ia a given range for a specific
     run of the game.
    b. 'AvatarObservers' - an abstract class that extends 'GameObject' to specify
     that a game object is an observer of the avatar game object and it should
      also implement a matching update method.
    c. 'Leaf', 'Fruit', 'TreeTrunk' - all the game objects for creating the flora.
     all of them extends the abstract class 'AvatarObservers', and updates
     themselves when the avatar jump.

2. Design Pattern - Observer:
    in this project i used 'observer' with the abstract class 'AvatarObservers'.
    the concrete classes the implements it are - 'Leaf', 'Fruit', 'TreeTrunk'.
    all of those, gets an update from the 'Avatar' object, whenever it jumps,
    and activates a transition.
    the class that contains the observer collection and the notifyObservers
    method is 'Avatar'
