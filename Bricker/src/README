questions:
1. To remove bricks in the game, I created an instance of BrickerGameManager
 in the constructor of BasicCollisionStrategy and used its public methods.
    * The advantages:
        leaving the sole responsibility for adding and deleting bricks, as well
        as monitoring these actions (actions related to the management of the
        game), in the game manager (encapsulation). Thus, we can limit the
        'add' or 'remove' operations and analyze them. In addition, if we want
        to extend the game in the future, an external and unsupervised change
        in the amount of bricks may cause disruptions in the game, which will
        be difficult to find.
    * Disadvantages:
        Creating an instance of BrickerGameManager in another class still breaks
        encapsulation to a certain extent and creates external involvement in
        internal operations of the game.
